This directory contains all the work which goes into the Tor Dissertation

v1-create-tor.sh # Is the script ran to BUILD A TOR LAB from scratch. This will perform the following:
	1. Create a directory from the location its ran
	2. Install onto the HOST SYSTEM telnetd for host-to-netkit communication
	3. Install Tor packages into the DEFAULT NETKIT FILESYSTEM 
	4. Perform an automated process of booting netkits, configuring Tor, and saving the configuratiosn to the host lab directory

performance-tests/ # Contains manually built labs for testing hosting environments, this is due to a certain computer being far too slow to run Netkit, and therefore a generic test is performed to ensure a host is suitable for a lab the size of Tor. 

tor-basic/ # Contains the first final manually built tor lab, this works but may contain human error

tor-world-template/ # contains the lab following the running of *v1-create-tor.sh*, which is automatically built by script and works from build, this directory is later copied and edited for the needs of this dissertation. 

tor-geographic/ # contains the content of *tor-world-template/*, except manually renamed, and Tor configurations manually edited, and due to the sheer size it takes too long to re-generate Tor keys and therefore THIS ONE FAILED

tor-geographic-post-script-template/ #Contains the *tor-work-template/*, with a script inside called **transpose-lab.sh**, which converts this automated build of a lab into the one used within the Dissertation in terms of nomenclature, e.g. renames dirauth4.startup to uk_relay3.startup

tor-geographic-rekey/ # contains the contents of *tor-geographic-post-script-template/* after having ran *transpose-lab.sh*, and then the tor configuration files are updated, since the name of all the hosts have changed, and their IP addresses have been ameneded - this is the *version used within the dissertation for section 5.5 Lab-03: Netkit/tor-geographic/*
